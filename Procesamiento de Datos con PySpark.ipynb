Las técnicas de preprocesamiento ciertamente pueden variar de un caso a otro, y se pueden usar muchos métodos diferentes para masajear los datos en la forma deseada. La idea de este modulo es exponer algunas de las técnicas más comunes para manejar big data en Spark. En este modulo, vamos a repasar los diferentes pasos involucrados en el preprocesamiento de datos, como el manejo de valores faltantes, la fusión de conjuntos de datos, la aplicación de funciones, las agregaciones y la clasificación. Una parte importante del preprocesamiento de datos es la transformación de columnas numéricas en categóricas y viceversa, que veremos en los próximos modulos y se basa en el **Machine learning**."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"fa3e15e9-b872-43ed-b8af-1350e151f618","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Creación de un objeto SparkSession\nEl primer paso es crear un objeto `SparkSession()` para usar **Spark**.

Una vez que se obtienen los resultados para cada conjunto de grupos, el último paso es combinar todos estos resultados. En el siguiente ejemplo, agregamos los datos, según el 'Subtipo de cliente', y simplemente contamos la cantidad de registros en cada categoría. Usamos la función `groupBy()` en **PySpark**. El resultado de esto no está en ningún orden en particular, ya que no hemos aplicado ninguna clasificación a los resultados.

Puede llevar más tiempo, en comparación con Pandas UDF, que se ejecuta bloque por bloque y ofrece resultados más rápidos. Hay tres tipos diferentes de UDF de Pandas: `scalar, grouped map`, y `grouped agg`. La única diferencia en el uso de una UDF de Pandas en comparación con una UDF tradicional radica en la declaración.

datos con Pandas, ya que es la biblioteca de procesamiento de datos más establecida que existe junto con NumPy y scikit-learn para Machine Learning. Dado que la tasa de adopción de Pandas es tan alta, no hay debate sobre el uso de Pandas como una biblioteca de procesamiento de datos estándar. Es bastante maduro en términos de ofertas, API simples y extensibilidad. Sin embargo, una de las limitaciones clave del uso de Pandas es que puede encontrar un obstáculo si los datos con los que está tratando son muy grandes en términos de tamaño, ya que Pandas no es muy escalable. La razón principal es que Pandas está diseñado para ejecutarse en una máquina de un solo trabajador en lugar de una configuración de varios trabajadores. Por lo tanto, para grandes conjuntos de datos, Pandas se ejecutará increíblemente lento o, por lo general, generará errores de memoria.\n\nSin embargo, para pruebas de concepto (POC) y productos mínimos viables (MVP), Pandas sigue siendo la biblioteca de referencia. Las otras bibliotecas, como Dask, intentan abordar el problema de escalabilidad que tiene Pandas procesando datos en particiones y acelerando las cosas en el frente de ejecución.\n\nHay algunos desafíos que aún persisten. Por lo tanto, cuando se trata de manejar big data y marcos de procesamiento distribuido, Spark se convierte en la opción de facto para la comunidad de datos. Una de las nuevas ofertas de Databricks es la biblioteca de código abierto llamada Koalas. Proporciona una API Pandas DataFrame además de Apache Spark. Como resultado, aprovecha la implementación de Spark de DataFrames, la optimización de consultas y los conectores de fuentes de datos, todo con la sintaxis de Pandas. En esencia, ofrece una buena alternativa para usar el poder de Spark incluso mientras se trabaja con Pandas.\n\nEsta biblioteca de Koalas todavía está en desarrollo activo y cubre más del 75% de la API de Pandas.\n\nHay una serie de beneficios de usar Koalas sobre Pandas cuando se trata de grandes conjuntos de datos, ya que permite usar una sintaxis similar a la de Pandas sin preocuparse demasiado por los detalles subyacentes de Spark. Uno puede hacer la transición fácilmente entre Pandas y Koalas Dataframes y Spark Dataframes. También ofrece una fácil integración con SQL a través de la cual se pueden ejecutar múltiples consultas en un marco de datos de Koalas.\n\nEl primer paso es importar koalas y convertir un Spark Dataframe en un Koalas Dataframe:"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"bb08d717-3e26-4136-a372-e16cac865a73","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport databricks.koalas as ks\n\nk_df = df.to_koalas()"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"da1a32ac-8686-4aae-91b5-d4ccfbff4eed","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["WARNING:root:Found pyspark version \"3.3.0\" installed.
